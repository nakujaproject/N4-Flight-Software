 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to N4 Flight software docs.
 * N4 Flight software is the code used to run N4 rockets at Nakuja Rocket Project. This code is built using FreeRTOS on the Arduino-ESP32 framework. It is designed to run either on AI-Thinker NodeMCU-ESP32 boards or ESP32-DOIT-DEVKIT V1. 

 * @section step1 Major features
 * This firmare has been improved tremendously from the previous versions and includes the following features:

 * @subsection step2 Modularity 
 * - Most of the code is now contained in separate files each perfoming its own singular task to ensure code maintainability and testing. 

 * @subsection step3 System Logging
 * - We have built a system logger to keep track of each and every operation that the flight computer undertakes. This can be be retrieved later and reviewed for post-flight analysis

* @subsection step4 HIL Testing Engine
* - A hardware-in-the-loop testing engine has been built into the flight software to allow us to "Test Like We Fly". This allows the flight computer to be tested and debugged way before flight day. Using an improvised XMODEM algorithm, we are able to upload test flight data and run necessary integration tests. 
* @note See Integration and Testing Procedures for more info

* @subsection step5 Flight data logging
* - Flight data logging has been improved. Using an onboard SPI Flash memory, we are able log sensor data and flight states. 
*
* @subsection step6 Data dump interface
* - A data dumping hardware interface has been added to ease the retrieval of data post flight data. 
* 
* @subsection step7 SAFE and FLIGHT modes
* - To prevent misfires during intergration and testing, this firmware implements SAFE_MODE that among others operations, disables the pyro-charges before POWERED_FLIGHT.
*
* @subsection step8 XBEE, MQTT, LORA, WIFI telemetry selection
* - For backward and forward compatibility, we implement a method to allow choice of data telemetry protocol being used. 
*
* @subsection step9 Double ejection
* - We implement drogue and main chute ejection algorithms for successful vehicle recovery
*
 * @section install_sec Building, Compilation and Downloading.
 * 
 *
 * @subsection step10 System requirements

 @endhtmlonly

 * - Upload the n4-flight-software code to the flight computer as per the instructions in the [Upload and run] section above
 *

 @subsection step16 How to use the Nakuja Flight Computer Testing Engine
 The testing engine is built to streamline the testing procedures and help inteprate the commands received from the Device Under Test 
 during the testing phase. It also helps in downloading the test data to the Flight Computer for simulation. 

 @subsection step17 Installation 
    @note In development 

@subsection step18 Downloading the test data
- Double click on the app to open. The following window appears. 
- Select the COM port that the flight computer is connected to. 
- Select the baud rate 
- Choose the test-data CSV file. 
- Click Connect. The flight computer will be connected to the PC via serial. [Connected on COM[X] ] shows on the status bar. 
- On the flight computer, press on the RESET/EN button and observe the serial Monitor. A code 21 should be received on the Serial Monitor every 4 seconds. 
Here is the X-MODEM commands list for quick reference:

- Click on Link Data. The test engine will download the test data to the flight computer, and the progress will be indicated on the serial Monitor



 * 
 * @section step20 Pre-flight software checks
 * The following checks MUST be performed pre-flight to ensure the software operates as designed:
 1. test mode pin toggle
 2. telemetry protocol selection
 3. clientID (rocket ID)
 4. arming check 
 5. DEBUG_to_terminal check - defs.h
 6. LOG_TO_MEMORY - defs.h

  * @section step21 WIFI network configuration
  * The software is written such that it allows connection to any WIFI being used, without
  hardcoding the WIFI credentials into the flight software. This will make the launch preparation faster as no code uploading needs to 
  be done on-site.
  Follow the procedure below to connect to WIFI:
  - After uploading the flight software to the computer, the serial terminal will show the following response. Note the 
  marked are which is of interest. 

@htmlonly
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="step-1-serial.png" >

    </div>
 @endhtmlonly
This shows that the flight computer has created a web portal and is waiting for connection from an external device.

  - When powered on, the flight computer will create an open WIFI network called "flight-computer". This network will
  be visible on any device within range.
  - The FC sets itself as an Access Point and will provide its own WIFI network to the for other devices to connect to.
  - On the ground station computer, or using a smartphone, connect to "flight-computer-1". (NOTE: The WIFI name will change depending on the name of the rocket being used )
  - Open the browser and go to the following IP address "192.168.4.1". This should open the following window in
  your browser.

  @htmlonly
    <div style="text-align: center;" height=400 width=200>

        <img src="step-1-res.jpg" >

    </div>
 @endhtmlonly
 - Click on Configure WiFi. The window below opens.
 @htmlonly
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="step-2.jpg" >

    </div>
 @endhtmlonly
  
  - Enter the WIFI SSID and password for the network you want to connect to. In this case it is the WIFI network used for telemetry
  transmission.
  - Press save. The flight computer will save the network credentials and auto-reconnect itself as a station to the launch WIFI network. 
  @htmlonly
    <div style="text-align: center;">

        <img src="step-3.jpg" >

    </div>
 @endhtmlonly

  â€“ Assuming that the you have supplied the correct login credentials, the ESP32 will now be connected to the WiFi network.
  - You can now stream telemetry over that network.
  - Make sure that the ground station PC and the flight computer are on the same network.

  * @section step23 Flight Data Collection and Kalman Filtering
  The main senors used in the flight computer are accelerometer and pressure sensors. We use the MPU6050 for acceleration and angular velocity measurements. We use the BMP180 for atmospheric pressure and altitude measurement. This data is collected as raw data which is then processed and filtered using the Kalman filter algorithm. 

  The ***Kalman Filter*** allows us to perform predictive recursive low pass filtering which greatly improves our collected sensor data which is safe for the state machine to consume. 

  To learn more about the Kalman filter implementation, refer to the kalman.h and kalman.cpp files in the src folder of the n4-flight-software.
